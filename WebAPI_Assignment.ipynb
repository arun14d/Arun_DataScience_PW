    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automation - When using an API managed by computers, less human effort is required and workflows can be easily updated to become faster and more productive.\n",
    "2. Developer efficiency and innovation - APIs empower developers to be more productive by reusing code in complex but repetitive processes. They don’t need to start from scratch as the API specifies how to assemble software components in a program.\n",
    "3. Improved value proposition - By using APIs made available by companies such as Amazon, Salesforce, or Twitter, an application can integrate those services into their own systems to make themselves more attractive to customers.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    " \n",

    "1. Implementing and providing API capabilities can be costly in terms of development times, ongoing maintenance requirements, and providing support.\n",
    "2. Scaling API requires extensive programming knowledge and the learning curve can fairly steep when understanding how to extend the capabilities of your API framework.\n",
    "3. Security can be a concern as APIs add another potential attack layer to programs/websites.\n",
    "4. Poor integration means that an API can be vulnerable to attacks, yet data breaches or losses have huge ramifications when it comes to the finances and reputation of a company. \n",

    "    4. POST is used to transfer data to the server.\n",

    "    1. The process where a request is sent after an API is set up with the correct endpoints is referred to as an API call.\n",
